Startpage is a sort of a proxy for google's search. You get google's results and it's a way to avoid the filter bubble since searches aren't personalized. searx.me is a metasearch engine. How do they stack up for keeping your searches private? Finally, what do you guys think about yandex? It gives decent results but doesn't make any claims on being private afaik. However, it's a Russian company so it's not like they're going to hand over data to Western intelligence and law enforcement agencies right? What else is out there?\r\n"
